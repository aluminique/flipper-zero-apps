# Flipper Share apps family

Direct, hardware-free file transfer between two Flipper Zeros — send any file from one device to another with **no cables, phones, computers, Internet or extra hardware**. One protocol (resumable, integrity-checked), different transports.

## 📻 [Flipper Share](flipper_share) — over Sub-GHz

Transfers files using the internal CC1101 Sub-GHz transmitter. The general-purpose option.

- **~700 B/s** — send an average `.fap` file or asset in under a minute
- Works over distance; broadcast: multiple receivers can download at once
- Install: [lab.flipper.net/apps/flipper_share](https://lab.flipper.net/apps/flipper_share)

## 🔦 [Flipper Share IR](flipper_share_ir) — over Infrared

The same idea rewritten on top of a custom IR modem, using only the onboard IR LED and TSOP receiver. Especially for old-school guys who remember the days of sharing memes over the IrDA port.

- **~130 B/s** — slower, half-duplex
- Works up to ~30 m line-of-sight without ambient IR interference — that is even farther than Sub-GHz version with the stock antennas
- Symbol timings chosen so it won't trigger nearby IR-sensitive devices, like TVs, ACs, etc.
- Install: [lab.flipper.net/apps/flipper_share_ir](https://lab.flipper.net/apps/flipper_share_ir)

## 💳 [Flipper Share NFC](flipper_share_nfc) — over NFC

The fastest flavor: an ISO14443-3A link between two Flippers held antenna to antenna.

- **~7 KB/s** — the fastest Flipper Share transport so far
- Works in contact (antennas together); an interrupted transfer resumes automatically when the devices touch again
- Install: [lab.flipper.net/apps/flipper_share_nfc](https://lab.flipper.net/apps/flipper_share_nfc)

## Other experimental transports

> **⚠️ WARNING:** Apps in that section are **experimental-only** and are not recommended for regular use.
> Consider using other Flipper Share transports (NFC, Sub-GHz, IR) for everyday file transfer.


### 🏷️ [Flipper Share RFID](flipper_share_rfid) — over 125 kHz RFID


An experimental flavor on the LF RFID coil: the receiver drives the field, the sender load-modulates it like a tag — one-way carousel, the receiver never transmits.

- **~315 B/s**
- Works in near-contact: hold the coils ~2 cm apart (not pressed together) and keep them still


### 🔌 [Flipper Share UART](flipper_share_uart) — over a 3-wire link

An experimental flavor on the GPIO header: USART1 at 230400 baud, full duplex, COBS-framed. The only transport that needs wires — and the fastest because of it.

- **~20 KB/s** expected (line-rate bound; estimate, not yet bench-measured)
- Needs three jumper wires: pin 13 ↔ pin 14 crossed, GND ↔ GND
